Feature: simple osquery attack (sanity check)

  Background:
    Given "osquery" is installed
   # And the following profile:
   #   | name     | value     |
   #   | hostname | localhost |

  Scenario: Verify server is available
    When I launch an "osquery" attack with:
      """
      osqueryi --csv 'SELECT COUNT(*) from firefox_addons;'
      """
    Then the output should contain:
      """
      COUNT(*) =
      """
